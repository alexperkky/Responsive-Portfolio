                <p>Hi there! My name is Alex Perkinson.
                    I am beginning to learn web design, which I enjoy greatly.
                    Before deciding to learn web design, I have worked as a pool professional,
                    as well as a freight handler for McDonald's.
                    Besides this, I love to play my guitar, play video games, watch pro wrestling,
                    and hang out with my cats Buster Posey and Paul since I don't really have friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have many goals in life, generally centered around creative endeavors.
                        I hope to one day publish a book, improve my drawing skills from stick figures
                        to something even slightly better, and to release some of the musical material 
                        I have had circling around my brain for years.
                    </p>
